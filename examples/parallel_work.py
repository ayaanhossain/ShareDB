'''
This example shows the use of ShareDB in parallel computing of linear
discrete convolution of vector pairs.

The vectors generated are rather large, so all data is stored and
distributed via SharedDB instances. This makes all available memory
free for computing the actual result. Additionally, all values are
stored in compressed format, further minimizing disk space.
